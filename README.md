## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of YAML and GitHub Actions

### Understanding YAML code

YAML Code is seperated into 5 parts

- Events
- Jobs
- Runners
- Steps
- Actions

* Linter: a tool composed of multiple linters that automatically checks code to ensure it conforms to specific standards and coding styles. It supports multiple programming languages and helps maintain consistent code quality across a repository.

Here is an example Super Linter YAML file:

```
name: Super-Linter

on: push # specifies when the workflow is triggered (when pushing code)

jobs:
  super-lint: # one job that has multiple steps
    name: Lint code Base
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # container environment (hosted on GH.com)
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Super-Linter
        uses: github/super-linter@v4
        env:
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

WORKFLOW FILES MUST BE IN Repository DIRECTIORY `~/.github/workflows/superlinter.YML`
